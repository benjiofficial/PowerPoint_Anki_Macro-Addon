# PowerPoint Anki Macro & Addon
A macro you can use for powerpoint to import straight into Anki. 

Some shit code I made (only works on MacOS)
(Please excuse the horrible code, I haven't coded in a while and I've never used VBA)
Currently you have to format the notes section like a CSV, but if anyone can be bothered to improve it you are more than welcome to do so.
There's 2 parts to this, a macro which you add to the powerpoint file and an addon which you add to the addons folder

**Macro**
You need to add this to your PowerPoint file when you save it locally, or you can make a template or something - all it does is export the notes and the file path to a location called ~/.anki:

**Addon**
Create an addon folder (mine was called 123_321) and add the file __init__.py
